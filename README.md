# `xmpp-cloud-auth`: Your authentication hub for Nextcloud, Instant Messaging, and mail

`xmpp-cloud-auth` (aka `xcauth`) started as a simple program to free [JSXC â€“ The Open Chat](https://www.jsxc.org) for [Nextcloud](https://www.nextcloud.com) from having to remember and reuse passwords: The password entered for Nextcloud login would need to be captured and stored in the browser in such a way that malware could also access it.

In the meantime, it has grown to a full authentication hub:

For installation and configuration instructions, see [doc/Installation.md](doc/Installation.md). :warning: Especially if you plan to [use it on *Prosody*](doc/Installation.md#prosody), as their `mod_auth_external.lua` does not work around a bug in `lpty`.
