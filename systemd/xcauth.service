Description=XMPP to Nextcloud+JSXC authentication bridge

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/xcauth
User=xcauth
Sockets=xcauth.socket xcejabberd.socket xcpostfix.socket xcprosody.socket xcsaslauth.socket
# Should be doable in `xcsaslauth.socket` according to
# https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html#ExecStartPre=
# but doesn't for me in Ubuntu 18.04. So I moved it here.
#
# The downside of this setup: saslauth connection may not occur before
# manual `systemctl start xcauth.service` or connection to one of the
# other sockets.
#
# Do not fail if /var/run/saslauthd does not exist
ExecStartPre=-+/bin/chgrp sasl /var/run/saslauthd/
